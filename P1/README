WELCOME to README

This simple program counts each word in any given file. 
The count of the words are arranged in descending order. The program must take file name as its first argument.
As for this assignments I had to do alot of internet digging. Making the project compatible with python3 was alittle challenging, otherthan that sorting was also alittle challenge.
Other than that everything else went smooth.
As a result of explaination I have included some comments in my program as to what I am doing so that it makes more sense to whoever reads my program.

The usage of the program has been given below:

usage: python3 wf.py [filename]

for example:

python3 wf.py Gettysburg-Address.txt
